# API Implementation and Reuse

TIBCO Cloud Integration allows an organization to easily implement with API-Led development practices (following the Gartner Bi-Modal architecture principle).  

For implementing the API spec lets start with a connection creation needed for the app. Navigate to "Integration Apps" from menu as below:

<img src="/images/apiimp/1_1.png" alt="APIIMP" width=850/>

## Creating a connection to CRM DB
Let's create a Connection to develop our integration app.

**Your TIBCO workshop facilitator should provide you with the Database connection details needed for this step.**  

*Note: A sample of the database connection parameters are available in the downloaded git repository, at the location: /TIBCO-Cloud-Integration-Virtual-Workshop/labfiles/flogoapp/crmdbconnection.md*

From the Menu, Choose Connections > then add connection > enter mysql to find connector:
<img src="/images/apiimp/1.png" alt="APIIMP" width=850/>

Click on Connection and enter the details given by your TIBCO workshop facilitator > click Connect:

Name:
```
custDB
```

Host:
```
mysqltciinstance.ccvct4moy0lt.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
```

Port:
```
3306
```

Database Name:
```
CustomerDB
```

User:
```
******** (Provide by workshop facilitator)
```

Password:
```
******** (Provide by workshop facilitator)
```

A connection will be successfully added as below:

## Creating an App (A Microservice)

With API Specification created and mocked-up, we are ready to build the actual service based on the specification.

For this workshop, we will use **'Flogo'**, a lightweight integration tool available in TCI, to build a microservice from the API Spec.

**Navigate to Flogo capability as shown below:**

Switch to "Apps" from the menu > click "Create/Import" button > Select Flogo > "Create New App"

<img src="/images/apiimp/4.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Change the name to "ShipmentWaiverApp" and click Create

<img src="/images/apiimp/5.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

### Using API Spec to create a "Post Method" flow in your app

On the next page "Add triggers and flows" select "Swagger Specification" and select "Shipment Waiver" specification >> click "Create"

<img src="/images/apiimp/6.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Wait a few seconds. As illustrated below, TCI automatically created a flow for the POST method you designed. We can now configure this flow and add additional steps as required.
Click on the flow to edit it:

<img src="/images/apiimp/7.png" alt="APIIMP" width=500/>

Notice that a trigger, a configure response and a return activity have been created for you:

<img src="/images/apiimp/oz8.png" alt="APIIMP" width=800/>

### How to map fields and add activities in a Flogo App

**This is also referred to as 'Orchestrating and Transforming' the microservice flow**

Since we used an API Spec to create the integration App, all the request inputs and response outputs are automatically mapped for you.
Let's click on the trigger and change the port number and save.
<img src="/images/apiimp/9.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Let's inspect the Flow Inputs:

<img src="/images/apiimp/oz10.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Let's inspect the Flow Outputs:

<img src="/images/apiimp/oz11.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

You can use a simple click and drag to move the activities within the flow. This will allow you to add new activities in order to build a complete end-to-end process. For this workshop we will be calling an existing RESTful API to 
- get a new transaction ID, 
- extract customer and product information, 
- log a message into the application log, and 
- implement the response sent back to the user.


### Adding a FetchCustomerDetails Activity  

Now, let’s start configuring the process API to achieve an orchestration of services..

Click on the return activity, and drag it a few of places to the right as illustrated below. Do the same for ConfigureHTTPResponse activity :
<img src="/images/apiimp/oz12.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Note: Everything you do here is automatically saved.

Then click on the first orange box, find the "MySQL" options, and select the ‘MySQL Query’ activity.

<img src="/images/apiimp/oz13.1.png" alt="add MySQL" width=700/>

Also rename that activity as **FetchCustomerDetails** by clicking on the pencil icon and under settings choose the connection we created earlier and save it  :

<img src="/images/apiimp/oz13.2.png" alt="add MySQL" width=700/>

Click on the input settings and enter the following sql statement:
```
select * from customer_details where Email=?para_email;
```

<img src="/images/apiimp/oz14.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Click next on the input and create input mapping as below and click save.
<img src="/images/apiimp/oz15.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Your "FetchCustomerDetails" activity is now completely configured.

### Adding a Log Activity  

We will also add "Log Message" activity to log the output of FetchCustomerDetails. 
Click on the next orange box, type "log" in the Activity search box and select **Log Message** activity.

<img src="/images/apiimp/oz16.png" alt="Create App" width=700/>

Rename the activity to **LogCRMOutput**.

Select **Input** > **message**, in the Upstream Output, expand the FetchCustomerDetails step and select **FistName**.
As we only expect one customer record will be returned, we manually repalce records[index] by records[0] as shown below :
 
<img src="/images/apiimp/oz16.1.png" alt="Create App" width=700/>


The remaining activities for the Process App can be built the same way.
When we are finished, the completed process orchestration will look similar to the one below.

However, don't worry, we have a pre-built application that has all these steps completed which you will import later in this workshop.
