# Understanding Low Code Business App in TCI
The next step is to enable an automatic approval process to the 'ShipmentWaiverApp'.
Remember that our end goal is to create a 'ShipmentWaiverApp' to automatically waive shipping fees for loyal customers and create more contextual offers.

A quick recap on our technical steps so far :
- Created an API Specification collaborating with business
- Created a Mock Application to agree and test the Spec
- In the process of creating a Web Based Flogo App to implement the API Spec

In other words, the microservice (getting built in Flogo) will be able to to reach out to a business process (built in LiveApps) to complete our 'ShipmentWaiverApp'

Here is how the **LiveApps** capabilities of 'Low Code Apps & Processes' are organized in TCI.

User's can navigate to the **Designer section** of the LiveApps, to view the processes after following the below steps.

# Importing a Business App

Your TIBCO Workshop facilitator should be able to share this Business App via an email. As participants, you will have to open the email and activate the app. Those steps are shown below.

## Activating a Business Application

 **Make sure you are logged into cloud.tibco.com using the same Email ID you registered for the Trial Account**

We would need to start by activating the copy of the business app shared to you on email (The email will come from no-reply@tibco.com).

Click Activate 
(Note: If your default web broswer is not Chrome, right click against the "Activate" button on the email and copy the address link. You can then go to Chrome and paste the link to the Chrome's address bar)

Once activated, the app needs to complete a test before it can be published for wider use. Close the Prompt > Click on "Test App".

In order to test further, we have to create a case for the business app.  Click New.

 <img src="/images/laactivate/3.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

Add values to shipping amount and click Submit.

 <img src="/images/laactivate/oz4.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>


Entering these values, creates a 'new case' for the business app we have imported. Close the prompt and open the case.

*In other words, the 'new case' is a simple way to test the business app we imported.*

 <img src="/images/laactivate/5.png" alt="laactivate" width=400/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/images/laactivate/6.png" alt="laactivate" width=400/>

An Action has to be taken for this case. Click on "Waive" button to activate flow for this action .

 Select the value as "Yes" and click Submit to complete the flow of this action. Observe the end state for the case changes to Waived.

The testing is now complete and we are ready to **publish** the Business App. Connecting it via "Flogo App". We will start by clicking the "Lock for Publication" action. Click on the arrow as shown below to exit the "Test Mode"

 <img src="/images/laactivate/10.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

 and, click "Lock for Publication". In the confirmation popup window, select "Lock" button

 <img src="/images/laactivate/12.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

The Business App is now locked and ready to be published. Click the "Publish in admin view" buttion.

 <img src="/images/laactivate/oz13.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

The business app is now ready for publication. Click Publish.

 <img src="/images/laactivate/14.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

The business app is now published and ready to be consumed in the Flogo application. Observe the change of state.
 <img src="/images/laactivate/15.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>


 Congratulations! You have now activated the business application required to complete the Flogo app.

 We will now Import our Flogo process app and interact with LowCode App to complete the rest of the workshop.

 Next step: [Import the Microservice to connect with the Shipment Waiver process.   ](4.importingapp.md)

 **We are very close to successfully implementing the API Spec into a functioning microservice, inorder to satisfy the main business requirement of automatically waiving shipping fees**
