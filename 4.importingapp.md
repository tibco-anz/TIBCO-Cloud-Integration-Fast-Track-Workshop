## Import Flogo App

We are going to use a prebuilt Flogo app for this hands-on lab.

### Importing a Prebuilt Flogo Application

1. Change the perspective to TIBCO cloud Integration and select "Integration Apps". Under Apps > Hit Create/Import > Select flogo > "Create New App".

4. The Import app dialog displays generic and specific errors and warnings as pertaining to the imported app. It validates whether the activities and triggers used in the app are available in the Extensions tab.

7. To correct the **fetch customer details** activity error, we must correct the db connection created earlier.  Browse and select the "custDB" you created earlier and hit save

<img src="/images/appimp/oz7.1.png" alt="appimp" width=500/>

8.  The next two errors are relating to the **CreateMarketoLeadFlow** app created and exposed via Cloud Mesh earlier. You will need to bind that service to the activity and select Save to correct the errors.

Replace message mapping from **string.tostring($activity[InvokeMarketoService].responseBody)** to **string.tostring($activity[InvokeMarketoService].responseCodes["200"])**

<img src="/images/appimp/oz9.png" alt="appimp" width=700/>

9.  Observe the errors of the next two activities that needs to be corrected .  These two activities are connected to Auto-approve “Waive Shipment flow” residing in “LiveApps” section of TCI platform.

Click  > Create Shipment Waiver Case and fill-in the Application and Case Creator fields to connect to the “Business Process flow”. Save and close.
*Note: The was the business app that was Activated via email and published earlier.*

Once Selected, Save.

Also make sure if you have following values set in your input fields

and

<img src="/images/appimp/12_2.jpg" alt="appimp" width=700/>


10. Similarly, correct and the “LiveAppsPerfomCaseAction” activity as below with the appropriate Application and Case Action. Save and close.

<img src="/images/appimp/oz13.png" alt="appimp" width=700/>

Also Double-check if you have following values set in your input fields

<img src="/images/appimp/13_1.jpg" alt="appimp" width=700/>

and,

<img src="/images/appimp/13_2.jpg" alt="appimp" width=700/>

Congratulations! Your app is now fully configured and published for anyone to test and use.
**Let's start testing the completed app.**

### Testing

In this section we will test the **Shipment Waiver API** implementation.

1.	Select Endpoint to open and hit Start testing.
<img src="/images/appimp/19.png" alt="appimp" width=700/>

2.	Select Create a Launch Configuration.
<img src="/images/appimp/20.png" alt="appimp" width=700/>

3.	Expand Activity Input flowInputs -> Customer -> loginId.  Enter ‘EmailID’ into flowInputs.  Use double quotes "". *(This is because we have defined the emailid field as type string)*

Note : Enter "jtamboli@tibco.com" which is in the sample.

4. Similarly Enter data into other fields under Order > Id (in quotes) as well as shipping amount & Total amount.
```
{
    "customer": {
        "loginid": "jtamboli@tibco.com"
    },
    "order": {
        "id": "4",
        "Total amount": 100,
        "shipping amount": 10
    }
}
```

Select "Next" and "Run".

5.	Your Testing is complete.  Scroll down to see the response and confirm that Order is completed successfully to the response.
Inspect the Logs output

Select "Return" activity and should see the Order Number generated

Select Stop Testing and Cancel to exit out.


### Summary
In this exercise, you imported an application and extended it by reusing **Shipment Waiver API**.   You performed a local test to make sure your process app is able to connect to all distinct systems and is ready to be pushed further and be available for wider usage.
