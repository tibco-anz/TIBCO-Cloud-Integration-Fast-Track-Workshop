Once successfully pushed it will be in a stopped state and we have to scale it to single instance.

3)	Scale the instance to 1 using the upward arrow and click Scale.

So to Summarize ,

a) We created a shipment waiver spec , and ran mock tests.

b) Then we saw how to create a shipment Waiver app from spec and configure activities including creating a connection to CRM DB.

c) We imported a supporting app and exposed it to Cloud mesh . Also activated a low-code business app.

d) We then imported ready-made app and wired the supporting app using cloud mesh and corrected other activities for the flow.

e) Finally, We pushed it for deployment and tested the endpoints.

Now, either

we can take a quick look at the unified view on how to manage apps at runtime ..
