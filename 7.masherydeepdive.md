# Why do we need the TIBCO API Management - Mashery ?

The purpose of pushing the application and adding API Endpoint to an API Gateway like Mashery is to collate and expose them as Catalogs. TIBCO has helped many customers achieve this around the globe.

For example, here is a screenshot of Macy's API Catalog built using TIBCO Mashery.

## What is different about TIBCO Mashery ?

TIBCO Mashery scales at more than 2.6 BILLION calls per day servicing customers like Macy’s, NewsCorp Australia and many more.

TIBCO Mashery platform offers customers the agility to switch between their cloud providers, use multiple cloud providers or choose a hybrid cloud architecture to better manage their egress charges (as opposed to being tied to a particular cloud provider's API Gateway).This flexibility and cost savings is a great advantage to many of our customers.

## Ways to bring the API endpoint into Mashery
There are multiple ways an API endpoint can be brought into Mashery.

1. By directly publishing from the cloud Integration with a single click as discussed in previous section
2. By Importing (a file or URI)
3. By creating manually

## Working with the Mashery Control Center
Following steps summarize the configuration required for the API Management tool (Mashery) to secure properly and exposed over the Gateway.

Some of those steps are :
- Defining the API and configuring the endpoint(s)
- Applying Security layers
- Package related configurations on the API definition
- Plan(s) inside a package for the API Definition
- Testing the endpoint for user consumption

Mashery provides these options shown in the Dashboard below, to properly secure, define, configure and expose the endpoint of your application.
